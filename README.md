# YFIOB-Community-Mentorship-Platform
This project aims to boost YFIOBâ€™s efforts to foster a culture of community investment in youth by creating ways for teachers, parents, and volunteers to all connect around a shared passion to support youth needs. This project would involve designing a digital mobile or web app that helps facilitate support collaboration in mentoring youth on careers.
